# Gradient Descent

## Overview

Gradient Descent is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning and numerical optimization. It's particularly useful for minimizing a loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the function. This repo provides a brief overview of Gradient Descent and its implementation.

## What is Gradient Descent?

Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In machine learning, it's commonly used to minimize the loss function of a model by adjusting its parameters iteratively. The algorithm works by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters and then updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.
